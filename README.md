### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github Profile! I am `JustaMushroom`, an independant Software Developer

I am the creator of a couple of public Discord Bots:
- [The Bot of Giving](https://top.gg/bot/775789054448500806) : A Christmas-themed discord bot revolving around server activity
- [AnimeRater](https://top.gg/bot/923758734218494007) : An AI-powered anime searching and automatic scoring system
- An Unnamed Easter-Themed Bot : An Easter-themed bot involving the searching of easter eggs in server channels **(Not being worked on, completion TBA)**


I have also made some small utility programs in Python which are publicly available on my profile.

*(I have more projects that I am working on which I'll make open-source eventually)*

If you have any enquiries about any of my public bots, You can find me on Discord at `Just a Mushroom#4101` or you can join my personal Discord server by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/4tPNcsTV5A)

**Note: I am not accepting random and unexpected friend requests sent to my Discord account, joining the above server is the only way to get in contact with me on Discord**

<!--*I'll make more of my projects open-source eventually*-->
