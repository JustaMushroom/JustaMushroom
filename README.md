### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github Profile! I am `JustaMushroom`, a solo Software Developer

I am the creator of a couple of public Discord bots:
- [The Bot of Giving](https://top.gg/bot/775789054448500806)
- An Unnamed Easter-Themed Bot **(Not being worked on, will start sometime in 2022)**

I have also made some small utility programs in Python:
- [DiceRoller](https://github.com/JustaMushroom/DiceRoller)
- [automatic-discord-game-searcher](https://github.com/JustaMushroom/automatic-discord-game-searcher)
- *Other projects are either in private repos or are not on GitHub currently*

*All of the links above lead to the GitHub repos of these projects, you can also find them on my profile*

If you have any enquiries about any of my public bots, You can find me on discord at `Just a Mushroom#4101` or you can join the support server for all of my discord bots by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/XUX3x8ZWrp)

**I am not accepting random and unexpected friend requests sent to my Discord account, joining the support server is the only way to get in contact with me on Discord**


*I'll make more of my projects open-source eventually*
