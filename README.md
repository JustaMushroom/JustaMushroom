### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github Profile! I am `JustaMushroom`, an independant Software Developer

I am the creator of a couple of public Discord Bots:
- [The Bot of Giving](https://top.gg/bot/775789054448500806) : A Christmas-themed discord bot revolving around server activity
    - Technologies:
        * NodeJS
        * Discord.js
        * SQL
        * Discord API
    * Re-writing in pycord

- [AnimeRater](https://top.gg/bot/923758734218494007) : An AI-powered anime searching and automatic scoring system
    - Technologies:
        * pycord
        * SQL
        * Discord API

- A Currently Unnamed Easter-Themed Bot : An Easter bot involving the searching of easter eggs in server channels **(Not being worked on, completion TBD)**


I have also made some small utility programs in Python which are publicly available on my profile.

If you have any enquiries, you can find me on Discord at `Just a Mushroom#4101` or you can join my personal Discord server by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/4tPNcsTV5A)

I am also contactable by email at `ramshaw.ryan@outlook.com` or `justamushroom74@gmail.com` *(I'll get more professional addresses in the future)*

**Note: I am not accepting random and unexpected friend requests sent to my Discord account, joining the above server is the only way to get in contact with me on Discord without stumbling across me on a public community server**

You can support me over at [my Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/justamushroom)!

<!--*I'll make more of my projects open-source eventually*-->
